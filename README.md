### Hi there! My name is Drew! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on progressing my skills as a Data Engineer. In addition to my main focus of data engineering, I also enjoy studying other elements of software development to assist in gaining a deeper understanding of the industry as a whole!
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me at: [d.white0002@gmail.com](mailto:d.white0002@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides spending time with my family, in my free time, I enjoy doing Danzan Ryu Ju Jitsu as well as recording my own music. I also have a diverse career history and own my own barber shop. I still periodically cut hair on the side!
